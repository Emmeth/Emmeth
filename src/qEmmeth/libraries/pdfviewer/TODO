- add print support (there seems to be no cross-platform way of printing PDF files :( )
- add fit width, fit to page
- allow selection to cross page boundaries
- add annotation support (this seems to be very complicated :( )
- add support for embedded files
- add "--clean-file-info-cache" flag which removes the information about files that do not exist anymore
