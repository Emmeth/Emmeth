PdfViewer is a program for viewing PDF files.

This program is based on the Poppler Qt4 Demo PDF Viewer.

Usage
-----

The usage is quite straightforward, I guess.

Note that the user interface can be completely controlled using the keyboard
(except for the magnifying glass and the links). When no menu bar is shown,
the items in the tool bar can be triggered using Alt + their accelerator.
The "Open File" dialog can be accessed using the standard "Open" shortcut
(in an English system this is usually "Ctrl+O").

"Forward search" and "inverse search" w.r.t. the LaTeX document that is at
the origin of the PDF file is available if PdfViewer is compiled with QtDBus
support. In the editor you should set the viewer command to:

  pdfviewer "file:$file.pdf#src:$linenumber $file.tex"

where $file and $linenumber are replaced by the flags applicable in your
editor. For example, in LyX you would use:

  pdfviewer "file:$$o#src:$$n $$t"

and in Texmaker you would use:

  pdfviewer "file:%.pdf#src:@ %.tex"
