The following are required for compilation:
- an ordinary C++ development environment (g++, make, C++ libraries and
  headers, ...)
- cmake (optional; you can also use qmake)
- a Qt 4 development environment (libraries, headers, qmake, ...): only
  QtCore, QtGui and QtXml are required, at least in version 4.7
- the poppler-qt4 libraries and headers, at least in version 0.16
- the zlib libraries and headers (optional; if zlib is not installed,
  synctex support will not be compiled)

In Ubuntu you would obtain those by installing the following packages:
- build-essential
- cmake (if you want to install the KDE version)
- libqt4-dev
- qt4-dev-tools
- libpoppler-qt4-dev
- zlib1g-dev

Install using qmake:
--------------------

1. Edit the paths in qmake/pdfviewlibconfig.pri
   If zlib is not installed, then synctex support must be disabled by
   hiding the line
     CONFIG += use_synctex
   in qmake/pdfviewlibconfig.pri (i.e. put a # at the beginning of that
   line).
2. Run the following commands (this will create a library named pdfview):
     mkdir buildqt
     cd buildqt
     qmake ../lib.pro
     make
     sudo make install

Note that qmake will tell you where the files will be installed. If
you don't like the installation directories, you can change them in
the file qmake/pdfviewlibconfig.pri before running make.  Make sure to
make the changes in qmake/pdfviewlibconfig.pri before running make.

In order to uninstall the pdfview library run the following command
in the build directory:
  sudo make uninstall

Install using cmake:
--------------------

1. Edit the paths in cmake/modules/PdfViewLibConfig.cmake
   If zlib is not installed, then synctex support will automatically be
   disabled. Synctex support can also be manually disabled by hiding the
   line
     set(USE_SYNCTEX true)
   in cmake/modules/PdfViewLibConfig.cmake (i.e. put a # at the beginning
   of that line).
2. Run the following commands (this will create a library named pdfview):
     mkdir build
     cd build
     cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..
     make
     sudo make install

In order to uninstall the pdfview library run the following command
in the build directory:
  sudo make uninstall
