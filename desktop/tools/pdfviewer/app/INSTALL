The following are required for compilation:
- an ordinary C++ development environment (g++, make, C++ libraries and
  headers, ...)
- cmake (optional; you can also use qmake)
- a Qt 4 development environment (libraries, headers, qmake, ...): only
  QtCore, QtGui and QtXml are required, at least in version 4.7
- the poppler-qt4 libraries and headers, at least in version 0.16
- the zlib libraries and headers (optional; if zlib is not installed,
  synctex support will not be compiled)

In Ubuntu you would obtain those by installing the following packages:
- build-essential
- cmake (if you want to install the KDE version)
- libqt4-dev
- qt4-dev-tools
- libpoppler-qt4-dev
- zlib1g-dev

If the non-standalone version of the app is compiled, then the PdfView library
must already be installed in your system. See ../lib/INSTALL for instructions.

Install app (depending on an already installed PdfView library) using qmake:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Edit the paths in qmake/pdfviewerconfig.pri
2. Run the following commands (this will create an executable named pdfviewer):
     mkdir buildqt
     cd buildqt
     qmake ../pdfviewer.pro
     make
     sudo make install

Note that qmake will tell you where the files will be installed. If
you don't like the installation directories, you can change them in
the file qmake/pdfviewerconfig.pri before running make.  Make sure to
make the changes in qmake/pdfviewerconfig.pri before running make.

In order to uninstall pdfviewer run the following command in the build
directory:
  sudo make uninstall

Install standalone (i.e. not depending on a PdfView library) app using qmake:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Edit the paths in app/pdfviewerconfig.pri
   If zlib is not installed, then synctex support must be disabled by
   hiding the line   
     CONFIG += use_synctex
   in qmake/pdfviewerconfig.pri (i.e. put a # at the beginning of
   that line).
2. Run the following commands (this will create a standalone executable
   named pdfviewer):
     mkdir buildqt
     cd buildqt
     qmake ../pdfviewer-standalone.pro
     make
     sudo make install

Note that qmake will tell you where the files will be installed. If
you don't like the installation directories, you can change them in
the file qmake/pdfviewerconfig.pri before running make.  Make sure to
make the changes in qmake/pdfviewerconfig.pri before running make.

In order to uninstall pdfviewer run the following command in the build
directory:
  sudo make uninstall

Install app (depending on an already installed PdfView library) using cmake:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Edit the paths in cmake/modules/PdfViewerConfig.cmake
2. Run the following commands (this will create an executable named pdfviewer):
     mkdir build
     cd build
     cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..
     make
     sudo make install

In order to uninstall pdfviewer run the following command in the build
directory:
  sudo make uninstall

Compile without QtDBus:
-----------------------

On some systems QtDBus might not be available (or you may have other reasons
for not using QtDBus). It is possible to compile PdfViewer without QtDBus
support. If you use qmake to compile PdfViewer, then you must comment the
line "CONFIG += qdbus" (i.e. add # at the beginning of that line) in
qmake/pdfviewer.pro and qmake/pdfviewer-standalone.pro before running qmake;
if you use cmake, then you must comment the line "set(USE_QDBUS true)"
(i.e. add # at the beginning of that line) in
cmake/modules/PdfViewerConfig.cmake before running cmake. Note that when
QtDBus is disabled, a new PdfViewer window will be opened each time you
trigger "forward search" in your LaTeX editor.
