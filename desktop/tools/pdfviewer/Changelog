- let cmake find zlib
- allow to compile without synctex support
- PdfViewer can now be compiled as app-only or as app+lib, both when qmake
  and cmake are used

  "Print to PDF" doesn't follow the settings specified in the Print dialog)

- remove bug: when the PDF file is changed on disk it is not reloaded in
  PdfViewer
- small changes to qmake and cmake configuration
- make the library compilable with -DQT_NO_CAST_FROM_ASCII
  -DQT_NO_CAST_TO_ASCII -DQT_STRICT_ITERATORS -DQT_NO_URL_CAST_FROM_STRING

version 0.5 (2012-05-30):
- refactoring to split the pdf view from the rest of the application and
  to allow the creation of a library providing a pdfview widget
- remove crash when clicking on the view when no file has been loaded yet
  (for several mouse tools)
- remove crash when the file settings cache is set to a very small number
- avoid loading invisible pages during zoom when we are at the very start
  or very end of the document
- when the toolbar is hidden in a setup without menu bar, the context menu of
  the page view shows an item "Add Main ToolBar"
- allow showing the menu bar from the configuration dialog (a restart is
  needed for this change to take effect)
- whether to fetch the icons from the local KDE theme can now be configured
  in the apps main CMakeLists.txt file before compilation
version 0.4 (2012-04-12):
- complete rewrite of the view (should be easier to maintain in the future)
- make sure the toolbar configuration popup menu (right click on toolbar)
  stays completely inside the screen
- maintain a separate bookmarks list for each file and remember the list
  when the file is opened again
- add different mouse tools: magnify (existed already), browse, select image
  or text in rectangular area, text selection
- faster startup by not fetching the icons from the local KDE theme (they can
  be reenabled by uncommenting the commented code in src/utils/icon.h and
  then recompiling)

- faster closing of the application when a large document (such as the PGF
  manual is loaded)

  document anymore (but now we have the bug that when all dock widgets are
  closed, the pages are not recentered)
