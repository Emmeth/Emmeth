The following are required for compilation:
- an ordinary C++ development environment (g++, make, C++ libraries and
  headers, ...)
- cmake (optional; you can also use qmake)
- a Qt 4 development environment (libraries, headers, qmake, ...): only
  QtCore, QtGui and QtXml are required, at least in version 4.7
- the poppler-qt4 libraries and headers, at least in version 0.16
- the zlib libraries and headers (optional; if zlib is not installed,
  synctex support will not be compiled)

In Ubuntu you would obtain those by installing the following packages:
- build-essential
- cmake (if you want to install the KDE version)
- libqt4-dev
- qt4-dev-tools
- libpoppler-qt4-dev
- zlib1g-dev

Install app and lib using qmake:
--------------------------------

1. Edit the paths in app/qmake/pdfviewerconfig.pri and
   lib/qmake/pdfviewlibconfig.pri
   If zlib is not installed, then synctex support must be disabled by
   hiding the line   
     CONFIG += use_synctex
   in lib/qmake/pdfviewlibconfig.pri (i.e. put a # at the beginning of
   that line).
2. Run the following commands (this will create a library named pdfview
   and an executable named pdfviewer):
     mkdir buildqt
     cd buildqt
     qmake ../pdfviewer.pro
     make
     sudo make install

Note that qmake will tell you where the files will be installed. If
you don't like the installation directories, you can change them in
the files app/qmake/pdfviewerconfig.pri and lib/qmake/pdfviewlibconfig.pri
before running make.  Make sure to make the changes in
app/qmake/pdfviewerconfig.pri and lib/qmake/pdfviewlibconfig.pri before
running make.

In order to uninstall pdfviewer and the pdfview library run the following
command in the build directory:
  sudo make uninstall

Install standalone app using qmake:
-----------------------------------

1. Edit the paths in app/qmake/pdfviewerconfig.pri
2. Run the following commands (this will create a library named pdfview
   and an executable named pdfviewer):
     mkdir buildqt
     cd buildqt
     qmake ../pdfviewer-standalone.pro
     make
     sudo make install

Note that qmake will tell you where the files will be installed. If
you don't like the installation directories, you can change them in
the file app/qmake/pdfviewerconfig.pri before running make.  Make sure to
make the changes in app/qmake/pdfviewerconfig.pri before running make.

In order to uninstall pdfviewer run the following command in the build
directory:
  sudo make uninstall

Install app and lib using cmake:
--------------------------------

Install the lib and the app separately by going in the respective
directories and following the instructions under "Install using cmake"
in the respective INSTALL files. Make sure that the library is installed
in your system before compiling the app.

Install standalone app using cmake:
-----------------------------------

1. Edit the paths in app/cmake/modules/PdfViewerConfig.cmake
   If zlib is not installed, then synctex support will automatically be
   disabled. Synctex support can also be manually disabled by hiding the
   line
     set(USE_SYNCTEX true)
   in app/cmake/modules/PdfViewerConfig.cmake (i.e. put a # at the beginning
   of that line).
2. Run the following commands (this will create an executable named pdfviewer):
     mkdir build
     cd build
     cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr ..
     make
     sudo make install

In order to uninstall pdfviewer run the following command in the build
directory (doesn't work yet):
  sudo make uninstall

Compile without QtDBus:
-----------------------

On some systems QtDBus might not be available (or you may have other reasons
for not using QtDBus). It is possible to compile PdfViewer without QtDBus
support. If you use qmake to compile PdfViewer, then you must comment the
line "CONFIG += qdbus" (i.e. add # at the beginning of that line) in
app/qmake/pdfviewer.pro and app/qmake/pdfviewer-standalone.pro before running
qmake; if you use cmake, then you must comment the line "set(USE_QDBUS true)"
(i.e. add # at the beginning of that line) in the
app/cmake/modules/PdfViewerConfig.cmake before running cmake. Note that when
QtDBus is disabled, a new PdfViewer window will be opened each time you
trigger "forward search" in your LaTeX editor.
